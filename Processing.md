# Data Process

Data is streamed through sensors where patterns are detected over the input vector at any given time. The patterns are compared to those at the previous time step and sequence are detected over the the recent past.The sequence are combined into concepts with morphological and phonological representations. Any time that a given concept is activated by one signifier, the other signifier also becomes active regardless of its presence in the environment which triggers a “mental image” or simulated experience of that signifier. Representations of the environment are formed using concepts and a set of relations between concepts to describe the meaningful aspects and implications of the current environment.

Signifiers from the auditory system can be viewed as words that combine to form sentences, where the particular relations are selected according to syntax structure and the associated constraints. Each word is assigned a category which expresses the role it plays in the sentence, and defines the requirements that determine whether a sentence is meaningful. A syntactically valid sentence can then be analyzed in terms of instances rather than abstract classes. Higher-level analysis deals with additional constraints associated with classes that are more concrete than the initial syntactic categories.

During construction, the learned sentence-templates from past experience are continuously searched in order to find a match for the partially constructed sentence, which enables faster processing as a result of simply needing to test whether the predicted template is still working at each time step. Errors by an instantaneous cost function with respect to the predicted template. Incorrect templates produce a large cost initiates the search process until a better prediction is made. The cost function is used to reinforce the predictions made once a template is either completed or is contradicted by a new word. The reinforcement value at each time step from the original prediction to now is calculated by a power law distribution over time, multiplied by the at the current time step.

Templates may be switched with modified versions if specific types of errors occur, avoiding the search process all together. The specialized variation preserves the central structure of the original template, while creating, deleting¬, or manipulating words that influence exact meaning of the sentence. Error types are defined by a pair of word classes- the actual class and the incorrect predicted class- with respect to the current template. The detection of an error type with respect to the current template triggers a new template that swaps out the current one, bypassing the extensive search process that would otherwise be necessary.
